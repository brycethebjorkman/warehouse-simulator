# warehouse-simulator

The main goal of this project is to develop a networked control system for a warehouse.
The warehouse will receive packages as inputs and produce packages as outputs.
The warehouse will mainly be composed of a sortation system and an automated storage and retrieval system.
The control system will receive high-level commands (presumably from an operator or automated order fulfillment system) as reference inputs,
and interact with the sortation system and the automated storage and retrieval system.
The network connecting the different computer systems of this warehouse will be an implementation of IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking.
